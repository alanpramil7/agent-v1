# Overview

This project leverages a modern tech stack designed to combine web development, artificial intelligence, and efficient data storage. Python serves as the foundational programming language, while other components handle specific tasks such as API development, natural language processing, and data persistence. The stack is designed to be modular, scalable, and capable of supporting advanced AI-driven features.

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): The core programming language.

- [**LangGraph**](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph): Low-level orchestration framework for building controllable agents.

- [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com): Get up and running with large language models.

- [**Azure OpenAI**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service): Provides AI and language model services.

- [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): A web framework for building APIs.

- [**LangChain**](https://langchain.com): A framework for integrating language models into the application.

- [**Postgres**](https://www.postgresql.org/): A relational database for structured data.

- [**ChromaDB**](https://www.trychroma.com/): A vector database for embeddings and similarity search.
