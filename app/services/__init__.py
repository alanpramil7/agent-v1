Services Package

This package contains service modules that implement the core business logic
of the application. Each service is responsible for a specific domain area
and encapsulates the operations related to that domain.

Services typically:
- Communicate with external APIs and resources
- Process and transform data
- Handle business logic and rules
- Interact with databases and storage
- Provide functionality to API endpoints
