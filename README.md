## About This Project

The SQL Data Chat Agent is designed to bridge the gap between technical SQL databases and business users, specifically in the context of Azure cloud resources and cost management. It provides a natural language interface to SQL databases, allowing users to ask questions in plain English and receive accurate, data-driven responses.

Key features:
- Natural language understanding
- SQL query generation and execution
- Document retrieval for contextual information
- Website and wiki content indexing
- Azure cloud services focus
- Streaming response capability

## Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions in plain English about your data
- **SQL Database Integration**: Connect to and query SQL databases without writing SQL
- **Document Processing**: Upload and query PDF, DOCX, TXT, and other document formats
- **Website Indexing**: Crawl and index website content for retrieval
- **Wiki Integration**: Connect to and index wiki content (e.g., Azure DevOps wikis)
- **Hybrid Knowledge Model**: Combines structured data (SQL) with unstructured content (documents)
- **Streaming Responses**: Get real-time feedback as the agent processes your question
- **Conversation Context**: Maintain context across multiple questions in a conversation

## Getting Started

1. Follow the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) to set up the agent
2. Configure your database connection and Azure OpenAI settings
3. Start the service and begin asking questions through the API
